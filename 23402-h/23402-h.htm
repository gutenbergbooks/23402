<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>TWO CHANCELLORS.</h3>

  <p>Although neither your readers nor I are politicians enough to
  interfere in the changes proposed with reference to the office of Lord
  Chancellor, I doubt not that some of them, now the subject is on the
  <i>tapis</i>, may feel interested in a fact connected with it, which our
  ancient records disclose: namely, that on one occasion there were <i>two
  chancellors</i> acting at the same time for several months together, and
  both regularly appointed by the king.</p>

  <p>It is an unique instance, occurring in the reign of Edward IV.: the
  two chancellors being Thomas Rotheram, Bishop of Lincoln, and John
  Alcock, Bishop of Rochester. The former received the Great Seal in May,
  1474, in the fourteenth year of the reign, and without any doubt
  continued chancellor till the king's death; and yet, from April to
  September in the following year, the latter was also addressed by the
  same title. During that interval of five months, there are numerous writs
  of Privy Seal addressed by the king to both, in which each of them is
  styled "our chancellor."</p>

  <p>This curious circumstance may be thus accounted for. King Edward had
  for some time been contemplating an invasion of France; and when his
  preparations were completed (about April), as he required his chancellor,
  Bishop Rotheram, to attend him on the expedition, it became necessary to
  provide some competent person to transact the business of the Chancery in
  his absence. On previous occasions of this nature, it had been usual to
  place the seal that was used in England, when the king was abroad, in the
  hands of the Master of the Rolls, or some other master in Chancery, with
  the title of Keeper: but, for some unexplained reason (perhaps because
  Bishop Alcock was a man whom the king delighted to honour), this prelate
  was dignified with the superior designation, although Bishop Rotheram
  still retained it. The voyage being delayed from April to July, during
  the whole of that period, each being in England, both acted in the same
  character; Privy Seals, as I have said, being sent to both, and bills in
  Chancery being addressed also to Bishop Alcock as chancellor. Rotheram
  was with the king in France as his chancellor, and is so described on
  opening the negotiation in August, which led to the discreditable peace
  by which Edward made himself a pensioner to the French king. No Privy
  Seals were addressed to Alcock after September 28; which may therefore be
  considered the close of this double chancellorship, and the date of
  Bishop Rotheram's return to England.</p>

  <p>Who knows whether the discovery of this ancient authority may not
  suggest to our legislators the division of the title between two
  possessors <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page258"></a>{258}</span>with distinct duties, in the same manner
  that two chief justices were substituted in the reign of Henry III. for
  one chief justiciary?</p>

  <p>The immediate interest of this fact has prompted me to anticipate its
  appearance in the volumes of my work, which you have been kind enough to
  announce as being in the press.</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Now God helpe sely Venus alone,</p>
      <p>But as God wold it happed for to be,</p>
      <p>That while the weping Venus made her mone,</p>
      <p>Ciclinius riding in his chirachee,</p>
      <p><i>Fro Venus Valanus might this palais see;</i></p>
      <p>And Venus he salveth and maketh chere,</p>
      <p>And her receiveth as his frende full dere."</p>
      <p class="i6"><i>Complaint of Mars and Venus.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Having in my last communication (Vol. iii., p. 235.) shown cause for
  the alteration in the foregoing quotation of Ciclinius into Cyllenius, I
  shall now endeavour to interpret the line in Italics, which in its
  present shape is utterly without meaning.</p>

  <p>Whatever word <i>Valanus</i> may be supposed to represent, whether a
  proper or a common name, still the construction of the whole line is
  evidently corrupt.</p>

  <p>Taking Valanus, in the first place, as a proper name, the most
  probable original would be <span class="sc">Valens</span>; for the
  connexion of which with Mercury we must refer to Cicero (<i>De Nat.
  Deor.</i> iii. 22.), where mention is made of it in these
  words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Alter (Mercurius) <i>Valentis</i> et Phoronidis filius, is qui sub
  terris habetur idem Trophonius."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here the identification with Trophonius strikes us at once as
  affording a clue to <span class="scac">THE CAVE</span> into which Venus
  fled, giving great probability to Valens as the true solution of
  Chaucer's meaning.</p>

  <p>But if we receive it as such, the following hypothesis becomes
  necessary, viz., that Chaucer imagined a <i>double impersonation</i> of
  Mercury&mdash;one absent, the other present,&mdash;one sidereal, the
  other mythological,&mdash;one Cyllenius, the other Valens.</p>

  <p>When Venus first enters Mercury's "palais," she "<i>ne found ne sey no
  maner wight</i>." This signifies the absence from home of
  <i>Cyllenius</i>, who was abroad upon "his chirachee" in attendance upon
  the Sun; and here again is an instance of the nice astronomical accuracy
  of Chaucer. It was impossible that the <i>planet</i> Mercury could be in
  the sign Gemini, because his greatest elongation, or apparent distance
  from the sun, does not exceed 29 degrees; so that the Sun having but just
  entered Taurus, Mercury could not be in Gemini. Neither could Venus see
  Valens (the other impersonation of Mercury), because of his concealment
  in the cave; but when she entered the cave, then she was welcomed and
  received by him.</p>

  <p>Now, to render the text conformable with this interpretation, some
  alteration in the construction is necessary, as indeed it must be in any
  attempt to render the passage intelligible.</p>

  <p>Taking, away the word "Fro," and transposing "might" to the other side
  of "Valanus," the lines would stand thus,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"&mdash;&mdash; it happed for to be</p>
      <p>That, while the weping Venus made her mone,</p>
      <p>(Cyllenius riding in his chirachee)</p>
      <p>Venus might Valens in this palais see;</p>
      <p>And Venus he salveth and maketh chere</p>
      <p>And her receiveth as his frende full dere!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On the other supposition of "Valanus" being a common name, to which a
  capital letter has been prefixed in mistake, then the only word for which
  it would appear to be a probable substitution would be "Vallum," in the
  sense of a border or rampart; but the application would be so far-fetched
  that I shall not attempt it, especially as I look upon the explanation
  afforded by "Valens" as most probably the true one.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Cure of Hooping Cough.</i>&mdash;There is a superstition in
  Cheshire that hooping cough may be cured by holding a toad for a few
  moments with its head within the mouth of the person affected. I heard
  only the other day of a cure by this somewhat disagreeable process; the
  toad was said to have caught the disease, which in this instance proved
  fatal to it in a few hours.</p>

  <i>weaver</i>), as they do not, I think, form any cocoon.</p>

<h3>THE THRENODIA CAROLINA OF SIR THO. HERBERT.</h3>

  <p>The <i>Threnodia Carolina</i> of sir Thomas Herbert is a jewel of
  historical composition, and I am persuaded that a new edition of it, if
  formed on a collation of the best manuscripts, and illustrated by
  extracts from the principal historians of the same period, would not only
  be received by the public with thanks, but with expressions of surprise
  that so rare a treasure should have been suffered to remain in such
  comparative obscurity.</p>

  <p>There are four manuscripts of the work in public libraries, two of
  which I am enabled to describe.</p>

  <p>1. The Harleian Ms. in the British Museum, No. 7396.</p>

  <p>This Ms. is in folio. The preliminary leaves have the notes marked 1,
  2, 3&mdash;the second being in the handwriting of sir William Dugdale.
  The narrative occupies thirty-six pages, with interlinear corrections and
  additions. This Ms. does not contain the words <i>This brief
  narrative</i>, &amp;c. nor the letter dated the 3d Nov. 1681.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">"THRENODIA CAROLINA."</span></p>

  <p>(1) "This book contains S<sup>r</sup> Tho. Herberts memoirs being the
  original in his own hand sent to S<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Dugdale in

  <p>(2) "A true and perfect narrative of the most remarkable passages
  relating to king Charles the first of blessed memory, written by the
  proper land of S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Herbert baronet, who attended upon
  his ma<sup>tie</sup> from Newcastle upon Tine, when he was sold by the

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">"VERITAS ODIUM PARIT."</span></p>

  <p>(3) "Court passages in the two last yeares of the raigne of king
  Charles the first, during y<sup>e</sup> time of his affliction."</p>

  <p>2. The Harleian Ms. in the British Museum, No. 4705.</p>

  <p>This Ms. is in small folio. It was formerly in the possession of Peter
  le Neve, norroy. A preliminary leaf has the subjoined attestation by sir
  William Dugdale. The narrative is much more ample and circumstantial than
  in the former Ms., but it is not all in the handwriting of sir Thomas
  Herbert. The letter dated 3 November 1681, and the relations of
  Huntington, Cooke, and Firebrace, are added in the handwriting of
  Dugdale; also, the names of persons who corresponded with Charles I.
  while he was a prisoner in the Isle of Wight. The passages transcribed by
  the <span class="sc">Rev. Alfred Gatty</span> appear in this
  Ms.&mdash;also in the edition of 1702. The edition of 1813 is a
  <i>verbatim</i> reprint of the first and second articles of that of 1702.
  It was edited by Mr. George Nicol.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">"CAROLINA THRENODIA."</span></p>

  <p>The other Mss. alluded to are preserved in the Ashmolean Museum at
  Oxford. The most important is No. 1141., which is minutely described in
  the admirable catalogue compiled by Mr. Black. A transcript of the
  <i>Threnodia Carolina</i> by Ant. à Wood, also in the Ashmolean Museum,
  is recorded by Huddesford.</p>

  <p>As there were two <i>recensions</i> of the narrative, I have added a
  specimen of each of the Harleian Mss., which may serve as a clue to the
  nature of other copies, whether in public libraries, or in private
  hands.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Thomas Herbert's Memoirs of Charles I.</i>&mdash;The question
  suggested by <span class="sc">Mr. Gatty's</span> first note upon this
  subject was one of some importance, viz., whether the original MS. in the
  possession of his friend contained anything of Sir Thomas Herbert's not
  hitherto published? There is no doubt that the "Memoir of the two last
  years of King Charles I." was written by Sir Thomas Herbert, after his
  retirement to his native city of York, at the request of the author of
  the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, who made use of nearly the whole of it in
  compiling that great work, adapting different portions to his
  biographical notices of the persons to whom they principally related. The
  notices of Colonel Joyce and Colonel Cobbet are chiefly composed of
  extracts from Herbert's Memoir; whilst under the name of Herbert himself
  not more than about one-third of his own communication will be found.</p>

  <p>The first edition of the <i>Athenæ</i> was not published until 1691,
  several years after Sir Thomas Herbert's death; and the memoir in a
  complete form, with the title of <i>Threnodia Carolina</i>, did not
  appear until the year 1702, when it was published by Dr. Charles Goodall,
  physician to the Charter House, together with other tracts relating to
  Charles I. This is doubtless the volume described by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Bolton Corney</span> (vol. iii., p. 157.), who will, I hope, favour your
  readers with the information requested by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Gatty</span> (p. 222.).</p>

  <p>The Memoir, as published in 1813 by G. and W. Nicol, Booksellers, Pall
  Mall, professes to be a faithful reprint of the former edition of 1702.
  The commencing and concluding paragraphs in this reprint are precisely
  the same as those transcribed by <span class="sc">Mr. Gatty's</span>
  friend from the MS. in his possession. His idea, that an incorrect copy
  of his MS. was improperly obtained, and published in 1813, seems to be
  without foundation.</p>

  <p>"Even after all the labours of the Prussian scholars," says Dr.

  writer are extant, where they are to be found, and, above all, whether
  from their age and character they are worth the trouble of an exact
  collation. A labour of this kind cannot be accomplished by individuals;
  but the present spirit of liberal co-operation, which seems to influence
  literary as well as scientific men throughout Europe, renders its
  accomplishment by the combined exertions of the scholars of different
  countries by no meals impracticable. It would be exceedingly convenient
  to possess an alphabetical list of all the extant Greek and Latin
  writers, with a <i>catalogue raisonnée</i> of the MSS. of each; and if
  such a work were attempted, there is little doubt, I imagine, that in
  point of number a very large addition would be made to the stock of MSS.
  already known. What the result might be in point of value is another
  question; still it is desirable to know what we have to trust to; and
  when we have obtained a right estimate of our existing resources in
  manuscripts, we shall then be better able to judge what modern criticism
  will have to do from its own means towards bringing the text of the
  ancient writers to the greatest possible state of

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>POEMS OF JOHN SEGUARD OF NORWICH.</h3>

  <p>In the <i>Letters on the British Museum</i>, 1767 (referred to Vol.
  iii., p. 208.), at p. 33. is given a short Latin poem, which the writer
  states he "found among the manuscripts;" and adds, "It was written by
  John Seward in the time of Henry V., who conquered Charles VI. of
  France." The poem is as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ite per extremam Tanaim, pigrosque Triones,</p>
      <p>Ite per arentem Lybiam, superate calores</p>
      <p>Solis, et arcanos Nili deprendite fontes,</p>
      <p>Herculeumque sinum, Bacchi transcurrite metas,</p>
      <p>Angli juris erit quicquid complectitur orbis.</p>
      <p>Anglis rubra dabunt pretiosas æquora conchas,</p>
      <p>Indus ebur, ramos Panchaia, vellera Seres,</p>
      <p>Dum viget Henricus, dum noster vivit Achilles;</p>
      <p>Est etenim laudes longe transgressus avitas."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If these lines are compared with the contemporary Leonine verses in
  praise of Henry V., preserved in MS. Cott. Cleop. B. i. f. 173.
  beginning:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ad Salvatoris laudes, titulos et honores."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>their great superiority, in point of Latinity, will be perceived, and
  this Query forthwith arises: Who was John Seward?</p>

  <p>In reply to this, the following information has been collected. The
  name of the author was not <i>Seward</i>, but <i>Seguard</i>. He is not
  mentioned by Leland, but Bale calls him "insignis sui temporis rhetor ac
  poeta;" and states further, that in the city of Norwich, "non sine magno
  auditorum fructu, bonas artes ingenue profitebatur." He then gives a list
  of his writings, among which is a work on Prosody, entitled
  <i>Metristenchiridion</i>, addressed to Richard Courtney, Bishop of
  Norwich, who held the see only from Sept. 1413 to Sept. 1415, and
  therefore composed during that interval. He notices also a tract <i>De
  miseria hominis</i>, together with <i>Carmina diversi generis</i> and
  <i>Epistolæ ad diversos</i>; all of which, he says, he himself saw in
  manuscripts in Merton College, Oxford, and in the Royal Library of Edward
  VI. Pits, the next authority in point of date, chiefly follows Bale in
  his account of John Seguard; but adds, "Equestris ordinis in Anglia patre
  natus," and among his writings inserts one not specified by Bale, <i>De
  laudibus Regis Henrici Quinti, versu</i>. Tanner copies the first of
  these statements, yet, singular enough, omits all notice of the poem on
  Henry V., the very one, apparently, cited in the <i>Letters on the
  British Museum</i>. But there are further difficulties. It was natural to
  suppose, that the MS. seen by Bale in the Royal Library would be there
  still; and Tanner unhesitatingly refers to the volume marked 15 A. xxii.
  art. 5., as the one which contained the poem <i>De miseria hominis</i>,
  noted by Bale. On looking, however, at this manuscript, it became
  apparent that both Bale and Tanner are in error in ascribing this poem to
  Seguard. The handwriting is of the early part of the thirteenth century,
  and consequently full a century and a half before the Norwich poet was
  born! At the conclusion is this note, by the same hand:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hos versus, sicut nobis quidam veridicus retulit, Segardus junior de
  Sancto Audomaro composuit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The writer here named is not mentioned in Fabricius, nor in the
  <i>Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>. Besides the MS. in Merton
  College, Oxford, referred to by Bale, which still exists there under the
  signature Q. 3. 1., I find another in Bernard's <i>Catt.</i> <!-- Page
  262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>{262}</span><i>MSS.
  Angliæ</i>, 1697, vol. ii. p. 216., among the manuscripts of Sir Henry
  Langley of Shropshire, "No. 22. Jo. Segnard [<i>read</i> Seguard]
  Poemata." I would therefore close these remarks by requesting attention
  to the following Queries:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. As Blomefield is silent on the subject, is anything more known
  respecting the biography of John Seguard?</p>

  <p>2. Can a list be obtained of the contents of the Merton
  manuscript?</p>

  <p>3. What became of the Langley MS., and where is it at present?</p>

  <p>4. In what manuscript of the British Museum is the poem on Henry V.
  contained?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">F. Madden</span>.

  <p>P.S. Since I wrote the above, I have found in the Sale Catalogue of
  the Towneley library, 1814, pt. i. lot 396.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Seguardi Opuscula.</i> Manuscript on vellum. This volume contains
  several treatises not mentioned by Bale or Pits."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was purchased by Mr. Laing for 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> May I,
  therefore, add one more Query?</p>

  <p>5. Can the present owner of this MS. (which is probably the same as
  the Langley copy) furnish a note of its contents?</p>

<h3>EPITAPH ON THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE.</h3>

  <p>Who was the writer of the oft-quoted lines,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Underneath this marble (sable) hearse," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>intended, as all know, for an epitaph on Mary Sidney, afterwards
  Countess of Pembroke, but not inscribed upon any monumental stone? They
  are almost universally attributed to Ben Jonson, and are included amongst
  his poems. But this is not conclusive evidence, as we also there find the
  epitaph on Drayton, which was written by Quarles. In Aubrey's MS.
  <i>Memoires of Naturall Remarques in Wilts</i>, these verses are said to
  have been "made by Mr. Willi&#x101;. Browne, who wrote the Pastoralls,
  and they are inserted there." Mr. Britton, in his <i>Life of Aubrey</i>
  (p. 96.), adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is essential to observe, that Aubrey is not alone in stating them
  to be by Browne; for, in his note upon the subject, he left a blank for
  the latter's Christian name, 'William,' which was filled up by Evelyn
  when he perused the manuscript. Indeed, Evelyn added as a further note,
  '<i>William</i>, Governor to the now Earl of Oxford.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But these lines are not to be found in Browne's <i>Pastorals</i>. In
  book ii., song 4., there is an epitaph, but which bears little
  resemblance to the one in question. It concludes with the following
  conceit:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If to the grave there ever was assign'd</p>
      <p>One like this nymph in body and in minde,</p>
      <p>We wish here in balme, not vainely spent,</p>
      <p>To fit this maiden with a monument,</p>
      <p>For brass, and marble, were they seated here,</p>
      <p>Would fret, or melt in tears, to lye so near."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Addison, in <i>The Spectator</i>, No. 323., speaks of this epitaph as
  "written by an uncertain author." This was not more than seventy-five or
  eighty years after Jonson's death. In the lives of the Sidneys, and in
  Ballard's <i>Memoirs of Celebrated Ladies</i> (1752), no author is
  mentioned; but the latter speaks of the epitaph as likely to be more
  lasting than marble or brass. To the six lines which generally stand
  alone, the following are added in the two last-mentioned works:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Marble pyles let no man raise,</p>
      <p>To her name, for after daies,</p>
      <p>Some kind woman, born as she,</p>
      <p>Reading this like Niobe,</p>
      <p>Shall turn marble, and become,</p>
      <p>Both her mourner and her tomb."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These are also given by Brydges in his <i>Peers Of James II.</i>, but
  they are not in Jonson's works. Did they originally form part of the
  epitaph, or are they the production of another and later author?</p>

  <p>That this epitaph should be attributed to Jonson, may possibly have
  arisen from the following lines being confounded with it. Jacob, in his
  <i>English Poets</i>, says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To show that Ben was famous at <i>epigram</i>, I need only transcribe
  the epitaph he wrote on the Lady Elizabeth L.&nbsp;H.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Underneath this stone doth lie</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>The Vellum-bound Junius.</i>&mdash;Mr. Cramp, in his late
  publication, <i>Junius and his Works</i>, conjectures that the printer
  having bound a copy of <i>Junius</i> for and under the direction of the
  writer of the letters, followed the pattern in the binding of other
  copies; and this, he says, "will account for similar copies having been
  found in the libraries of so many persons, which from time to time has
  occasioned so much speculation." With Mr. Cramp's conjecture I do not
  concern myself; but I should be much obliged if he would inform me,
  through your Journal, in what libraries, and where, these many
  vellum-bound copies have been found, and where I can find the
  speculations to which they have given rise.</p>

  <p><i>The Vellum-bound Junius.</i>&mdash;Some years ago, on reading the
  private letters of Junius, addressed to H.&nbsp;S. Woodfall, and printed by G.

  wherein he states a desire to have one set of his letters (which were
  published 3d March, 1772, by Woodfall) <i>bound in vellum</i>.</p>

  <p>Constantly bearing in mind the fact of the vellum copy, I invariably
  examined all the book <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>catalogues that came in my way for it. At
  last the long-wished-for object appeared in the Stowe sale, and I

  <p><i>What is a "Tye?"</i>&mdash;In Essex, many parishes have a place
  called "the tye," which I believe is always an out-lying place where
  three roads meet. In an old map I have seen one place now called "Tye"
  written "Dei." Is it where a cross once stood, and Tye a corruption of
  Dei? Forby, in his <i>East Anglian Vocabulary</i>, mentions it, but
  cannot make it out.</p>

  <p><i>Was Charles II. ever in Wales?</i>&mdash;There is a tradition
  amongst the inhabitants of Glamorganshire, that, after his defeat at the
  battle of Worcester, Charles come to Wales and staid a night at a place
  called Llancaiach Vawr, in the parish of Gelligaer. The place then
  belonged to a Colonel Pritchard, an officer in the Parliamentary army;
  and the story relates that he made himself known to his host, and threw
  himself upon his generosity for safety. The colonel assented to his
  staying for <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span><i>one</i> night only, but went away
  himself, afraid, as the story goes, that the Parliament should come to
  know he had succoured Charles. I know that Llancaiach was a place of
  considerable note long after that, and that an old farmer used to say he
  had heard tile story from his father. The historians, I believe, are all
  silent as to his having fled to Wales between the time of his defeat at
  Worcester and the time he left the country.</p>

  can be proved, in the most logical, full, clear, and satisfactory manner,
  that&mdash;<i>He never was at Rome</i>; and <i>never was, either
  nominally or otherwise, Bishop</i> <i>of the Church there</i>: and
  showing the grounds for the contrary assertion to be altogether baseless
  and untrue; being a tissue of self-contradicting forgeries and frauds,
  invented long subsequently to the time, evidently for the sole purpose of
  justifying the Papal pretensions of succession and derivation from the
  Apostle; as those, and all its other claims, are founded alone upon that
  fact, and must stand or fall with it.</p>

  acquaintance with Scripture and much theological learning (though the

  offence, and Joan's female statue long occupied her place among the Popes
  in the Cathedral of Sienna. She has been annihilated by two learned
  Protestants, Blondel and Bayle; but their brethren were scandalized by

<h3>BARONS OF HUGH LUPUS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 87. 189.)</p>

  <p>The inquiry of P., in p. 87., seems to indicate an impression that all
  the witnesses to the charter of Hugh Lupus to Chester Abbey were barons
  of the Palatinate, but only a few of them were such, the rest being of
  England generally.</p>

  <p>The original barons of the Palatinate were clearly distinguishable by
  possession of privileges confirmed to them by a well-known charter of
  Earl Ranulph III.; and all the Norman founders of their baronies will be
  found, under Cestrescire, in Domesday, as tenants in capite, from the
  Earl Palatine, of lordships within the lyme of his county.</p>

  <p><i>Bigod de Loges</i> (one of the subjects of P.'s inquiry) will not
  bear this test, unless he was identical with Bigot, Norman lord of the
  manors afterwards comprised in Aldford Fee, which is not known to have
  been the case. For this last-named Bigot, whose lands descended through
  the Alfords to Arderne, reference may be made to the <i>History of
  Cheshire</i>, <span class="scac">I.</span> xxix., <span
  class="scac">II.</span> 411.</p>

  <p><i>William Malbanc</i>, the other subject of inquiry, who has eluded
  M.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;T.'s searches, is easily identified. He was the Norman baron of
  Nantwich, the Willelmus Malbedeng of the <i>Domesday Survey</i> (vol. i.
  p. 265. col. 2.), and the name is also written thus in the copy of H.
  Lupus's charter referred to, which was ratified under inspection by
  Guncelyn de Badlesmere, Justiciary of Chester in 8 Edw. I.</p>

  <p>The charter, with Badlesmere's attestation prefixed, will be found in
  Leycester's <i>Cheshire Antiquities</i>, p. 109., and in Ormerod's
  <i>Hist. of Cheshire</i>, vol. i. p. 12. In the latter work, in vol.
  iii., the inquirer will also find an account of William Malbedeng or
  Malbanc, his estates, his descendant coheirs, and their several
  subdivisions, extending from p. 217. to p. 222., under the proper head of
  Nantwich or <i>Wich Malbanc</i>, a still existing Palatine barony.</p>

<h3>EDMUND PRIDEAUX AND THE FIRST POST-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 186.)</p>

  <p>In a recent number of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"
  (which, by the way, I have only recently become acquainted with) I saw
  the Queries of your correspondent G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;P. upon the above subject, and
  having some time ago had occasion to investigate it, I accumulated a mass
  of notes from various sources,&mdash;and these I send you, rough and
  unpolished as they are, in the hope that in the absence of better
  information, they may prove to be acceptable.</p>

  <p>Herodotus (viii. 98.) mentions the existence of a method of
  communication among the Persians, by means of horsemen placed at certain
  distances.</p>

  <p>In the Close and Misæ Rolls (<i>temp. King John et post</i>) payments
  are recorded for nuncii who were charged with the carriage of
  letters.</p>

  <p>In 1481, Edward IV., during his war with Scotland, established horse
  riders at <i>posts</i> twenty miles apart, by which letters were conveyed
  two hundred miles in two days (Gale's <i>Hist. Croyland</i>); and the
  Scottish Parliament issued an ordinance for facilitating the expedition
  of couriers throughout the kingdom. Carriers of letters also existed in
  England about this time, for in a letter from Sir J. Paston, written in
  1471, we are informed that "Courby, the carrier, hath had 40<i>d.</i> for
  the third hired horse," for a journey from Norwich to London and back.
  (Fenn's <i>Paston Letters</i>, 4to. vol. v. p. 73.)</p>

  <p>In 1542, letters reached Edinburgh on the fourth day from their
  despatch from London. (Sadler's <i>Letters and Negociations</i>.)</p>

  <p>In 1548, the rate to be charged for post-horse hire was fixed by
  statute (2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. cap. 3.) at one penny per mile.</p>

  <p>In 1581 (according to Camden), Thomas Randolph was appointed the first
  Chief Postmaster of all England.</p>

  <p>James I. established (date unknown) the office of Foreign Postmaster,
  which was first held by Mathewe le Questor.</p>

  <p>In 1631, Charles I. appointed William Frizell and Thomas Witherings
  (in reversion) to the sole management of the foreign post-office. And at
  this date it seems a regular home post was also carried on, as appears by
  the following entry from the Corporation Books of Great
  Yarmouth:&mdash;"1631. Agreed, June 6, with the Postmaster of Ipswich to
  have Quarterly 20<i>s.</i> paid him for carrying and bringing letters to
  and from London to Yarmouth for the vse of the Towne."</p>

  <p>In 1635, Charles I. issued a proclamation for the establishment of "a
  running post or two, to <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span>run night and day between Edinburgh and
  Scotland and the City of London, to go thither and come back again in six
  days:" branch posts were also to be established with all the principal
  towns on the road: the rates of postage were fixed at 2<i>d.</i> under 80
  miles; 4<i>d.</i> for 140 miles; 6<i>d.</i> beyond; and 8<i>d.</i> to
  Scotland. This is conclusive evidence that a regular post-office
  establishment existed nearly ten years <i>before Prideaux had anything to
  do with the post-office</i>.</p>

  <p>In 1640, a proclamation was issued by the Long Parliament, by which
  the offices of Foreign and Inland Postmaster (then held by Witherings)
  were sequestrated into the hands of one Philip Burlamachy, a city
  merchant. Soon after this we find a Committee of the Commons, with
  "Master Edmund Prideaux" for chairman, inquiring into the matter.</p>

  <p>In 1644, a resolution of the Commons declared that "Edmund Prideaux,
  Esq., a member of the House," was "constituted master of the posts,
  messengers, and couriers."</p>

  <p>In 1649 Prideaux established a weekly conveyance to every part of the
  kingdom; and also appears to have introduced other judicious reforms and
  improvements,&mdash;indeed he seems to have been the Rowland Hill of
  those days; but he has not the slightest claim to be considered as the
  "Inventor of the Post-office." The mistake may have arisen from a
  misapprehension of the following statement frown Blackstone: "Prideaux
  first established a weekly conveyance of letters into all parts of the
  nation, <i>thereby saving to the public the charge of maintaining
  postmasters</i>, to the amount of 7000<i>l.</i> per annum."</p>

  <p>I have not been able to obtain any particulars of Prideaux's personal
  history.</p>

  <p>[We avail ourselves of this opportunity of inserting the following
  extract from Mr. Rowland Hill's <i>Post-Office Reform; its Importance and
  Practicability</i>, p. 86. of the third edition, published in 1837, as it
  shows clearly the use which Mr. Rowland Hill made of the story in his
  great work of Postage Reform; and that Miss Martineau had clearly no
  authority for fathering the story in question upon that
  gentleman:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Coleridge tells a story which shows how much the Post-office is open
  to fraud, in consequence of the option as to pre-payment which now
  exists. The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'One day, when I had not a shilling which I could spare, I was passing
  by a cottage not far from Keswick, where a letter-carrier was demanding a
  shilling for a letter, which the woman of the house appeared unwilling to
  pay, and at last declined to take. I paid the postage, and when the man
  was out of sight, she told me that the letter was from her son, who took
  that means of letting her know that he was well; the letter was <i>not to
  be paid for</i>. It was then opened and found to be blank!'<a

  <p>The quotations of your correspondent G.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;P., from Polwhele's
  <i>Cornwall</i>, relate to the same individual, and a more general
  construction must, I think, be put upon the expression "our countryman,"
  than that it inferred a native of the county. The family of Prideaux was
  one of great antiquity, and originated in Cornwall (their first seat
  being at Prideaux Castle there), and had estates there in the time of the
  above Edmund. His father, Sir Edmund Prideaux, of Netherton (the first
  baronet), studied the law in the Inner Temple, where he became very
  eminent for his skill and learning. He is stated to have raised a large
  estate in the counties of Devon and Cornwall. He married  * * *;
  secondly, Catherine, daughter of Piers Edgecombe, of Mount Edgecombe,
  Esq., by whom he had two sons, Sir Peter his successor, and Edmund, the
  subject of your correspondent's Queries, who is thus described in
  Prince's <i>Worthies of Devon</i>, p. 509.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This gentleman was bred to the law, and of so great a reputation, as
  well for zeal to religion as skill in the law, it is not strange he was
  chosen a Member of that which was called the Long Parliament, wherein he
  became a very leading man; for, striking in with the prevailing party of
  those times (though he never joined with them in setting upon the life of
  his Sovereign), he grew up to great wealth and dignity. He was made
  Commissioner of the Great Seal [1643. Rushworth, vol. iii. p. 242.],
  worth 1500<i>l.</i> a-year and by ordinance of Parliament practised
  within the bar as one of the king's counsel, worth 5000<i>l.</i> per
  annum. After that he was Attorney General, <i>worth what he pleased to
  make it</i> [!!], and then <i>Postmaster General</i> ... from all which
  rich employments he acquired a great estate, and among other things
  purchased the <i>Abbey of Ford</i>, lying in the Parish of Thorncombe, in
  Devonshire, where he built a noble new house out of the ruins of the
  old," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Prideaux cannot be called the inventor of the Post-office, although to
  him may be attributed the extension of the system. The first inland
  letter office, which, however, extended to some of the principal roads
  only, was established by Charles I. in 1635, under the direction of
  Thomas Witherings, who was superseded in 1640. On the breaking out of the
  civil war, great confusion was occasioned in the conduct of the office,
  and about that time Prideaux's plan seems to have been conceived. <!--
  Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span>He
  was chairman of a committee in 1642 for considering the rates upon inland
  letters; and afterwards (1644) appointed Postmaster, in the execution of
  which office he first established a weekly conveyance of letters into all
  parts of the nation. Prior to this, letters were sent by special
  messengers, or postmasters, whose duty it was to supply relays of horses
  at a certain mileage. (<i>Blackstone</i>, book i. c. 8. s. 3.)</p>

  <p>I am unable to discover when Edmund Prideaux died; but it appears that
  either he, or one of his descendants, took part in the rising of the Duke
  of Monmouth in the West of England, upon which occasion the "great
  estate" was found of great service in providing a bribe for Lord
  Jeffreys. In the Life of Lord Jeffreys, annexed to the <i>Western
  Martyrology; or, Bloody Assizes</i> (5th ed. 266. London, 1705), it is
  said that "A western gentleman's purchase came to fifteen or sixteen
  hundred guineas, which my Lord Chancellor had." And Rapin, vol. ii. p.
  270., upon the authority of Echard, iii. p. 775., states that in 1685 one
  Mr. Prideaux, of Ford Abbey, Somerset, gave Jeffreys 14000<i>l.</i>
  [probably misprint for 1400<i>l.</i>] "to save his life."</p>

  <p>I think it likely that your correspondent may find further information
  upon the subject of this note, in the <i>Life of Dr. Humphrey Prideaux,
  Dean of Norwich</i> (born 1648, died 1724), published in 1748.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. B. Colman.</span>

  <p>Eye, March 18. 1851.</p>

  <p>Polwhele was clearly wrong in designating Edmund Prideaux, the
  Attorney-General, a Cornishman, as he belonged to the family long seated
  in Devonshire, and was fourteenth in descent from Hickedon Prideaux, of
  Orcharton, in that county, second son of Nicholas, lord of Prideaux, in
  Cornwall, who died in 1169.</p>

  <p>The four Queries of G. P. P. may be more or less fully answered by
  reference to Prince's <i>Worthies of Devon</i>, ed. 1810, p. 651.; and an
  excellent history of the Post-office in the <i>Penny Magazine</i> for
  1834, p. 33.</p>

  <p>Is it too much to ask of your correspondent, who writes from Putney
  under my initials, that he will be so good as to change his signature? I
  think that I have strong reasons for the request, but I will only urge
  that I was first in the field, under the designation which he has

<h3>LADY JANE OF WESTMORELAND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. i., p. 103.; Vol. ii., p. 485.)</p>

  <p><i>Jane</i>, Countess of Henry Neville, <i>fifth</i> Earl of
  Westmoreland, was daughter of <span class="sc">Sir Roger Cholmley</span>,
  of Kinthorpe and Roxby, co. York. (<i>Vis. York. Harl. MS.</i> 1487.
  <i>fol.</i> 354.) She is often confused with his other wife, Anne
  Manners, and also with her own sister, Margaret Gascoigne, both in the
  Neville and Cholmley pedigrees as <i>printed</i>. (Burke's <i>Extinct
  Baronetage</i>, art. <i>Cholmley</i>, and <i>Extinct Peerage</i>, art.
  <i>Neville</i>.) But while the Manners pedigree in Collins's
  <i>Peerage</i> (by Longmate, vol. i. p. 433.), as cited by Q.&nbsp;D., removes
  the former difficulty, that of Gascoigne is disposed of by the Cholmley
  pedigree in Harl. MS. above quoted, as well as by that (though otherwise
  very incorrect) in Charlton's <i>Whitby</i>, book iii. pp. 290, 291.
  313., and by the Gascoigne pedigree in Whitaker's <i>Richmondshire</i>,
  vol. i. p. 77. Thus we possess <i>legal and cotemporary</i> evidence who
  <span class="sc">Jane</span>, Countess of <i>Henry</i>, <i>fifth</i> Earl
  of Westmoreland, really was, without any authentic obstacle or
  unremoveable contradiction to its reception, viz. that she was a
  <i>Cholmley</i>.</p>

  <p>But I conceive your correspondent's identification is <i>totally</i>
  erroneous. It is true he only puts an hypothesis on the subject; but this
  hypothesis has no solid foundation. In the first place, Henry, fifth Earl
  of Westmoreland, died in 1549; and all authorities seem to agree that his
  first wife was Anne Manners, and his second Cholmley's daughter. Thus, if
  either of his countesses were living in 1585, it must have been the
  <i>latter</i>, by which means all chance of appropriation is removed from
  Manners to Cholmley. But I shall now give reasons for contending that
  neither of these ladies was your correspondent's Countess of
  Westmoreland, by referring him (2ndly) to Longmate's <i>Collins's
  Peerage</i>, vol. i. p. 96., where he will find that <i>Jane</i>,
  daughter of Henry Howard, the talented and accomplished Earl of Surry,
  married Charles Neville, <i>sixth</i> Earl of Westmoreland. He has
  evidently passed her over, through seeing her called <i>Anne</i> in the
  Neville pedigrees: "Anne" and "Jane" being often mutually misread in old
  writing, from the cross upon the initial letter of the last name.</p>

  <p>I offer it to your correspondent's consideration, whether his "Jane,
  Countess of Westmoreland," was not wife of the said Charles Neville,
  <i>sixth</i> Earl of Westmoreland, who was attainted 18 Eliz. (1575-6).
  His date is evidently most favourable to this view. It is true the
  attainder stands in the way; but if even this affords an obstacle, the
  next candidate for appropriation would be Jane <i>Cholmley</i>. Assuming,
  however, that your correspondent allows this lady as a candidate for the
  appropriation, her pedigree corroborates the claim. I have found, by long
  and minute observation, that hereditary talent, &amp;c. usually descends
  by the <i>mesmeric</i> <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page269"></a>{269}</span>tie of affection and favoritism, from
  fathers to the eldest daughter, and from mothers to the eldest son; and
  the pedigree of <i>Jane</i>, Countess of Charles, <i>sixth</i> Earl of
  Westmoreland, stands thus:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Besides being eldest daughter of the celebrated poet, the said Jane,
  Countess of Westmoreland, was sister of Henry Howard, the learned Earl of
  Northampton, her father's younger son&mdash;(some younger son, like
  eldest daughters, generally inheriting, physically, in some prominent
  feature, from the father).</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Ulm Manuscript</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 60. 191.).&mdash;In addition to
  the information supplied by <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span>, it may be
  mentioned that this manuscript is so called from having been referred to
  by Griesbach as the <i>Codex Ulmensis apud Gerbert</i>. This takes us to
  the <i>Iter Alemannicum, Italicum et Gallicum</i> of Martin Gerbert,
  published in 1765, at p. 192. of which work he informs us, that in the
  year 1760 this manuscript was preserved at Ulm in the library of the
  family of Krafft, which consisted of 6000 volumes, printed and
  manuscript. Of its history from this period till it came into Bishop
  Butler's hands, I am ignorant. Its reference at present in the British
  Museum is <i>MSS. Add.</i> 11,852.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="grk">&mu;</span>.

  <p><i>Father Maximilian Hell</i> (Vol. iii., p. 167.).&mdash;A querist is
  in conscience bound to be a respondent; I therefore hasten to tell you
  that Dr. Watt (<i>Biblioth. Britan.</i> iv. <span class="sc">Magnetism,
  animal</span>) should have written <i>Hell</i> instead of <i>Hehl</i>. It
  was that eminent astronomer, Maximilian <i>Hell</i>, who supposed that
  magnets affected the human frame, and, at first, approved of Mesmer's
  views. The latter was at Vienna in 1774; and perhaps got some parts of
  his theory from Father Hell, of whom he was afterwards jealous, and
  therefore very abusive. The life of Hell in Dr. Aikin's <i>General
  Biography</i> is an unsatisfactory compilation drawn up by Mr. W.
  Johnston, to whom we are indebted for the current barbarism
  <i>so-called</i>. In that account there is not one word on Hell's
  <i>Treatise on Artificial Magnets</i>, Vienna, 1763; in which the germ of
  animal magnetism may probably be found.</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of "strained" as used by Shakspeare</i> (Vol. iii., p.

  usually mouthed out, without much reference to Shylock or the play, as if
  it had been learned by rote from a school speech-book. Hazlitt says, in

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The author of <i>The History of the Church of Rome to the end of the
  Episcopate of Damasus</i>, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 384, which has
  just been published by Messrs. Longman, well remarks, "that he is not
  aware that there is any account of the Church of Rome, framed on the
  simple and obvious principle of merely collecting and arranging the
  testimony of history with regard to facts, and so presented to the reader
  as that he should leave a right to believe that when he has read what is
  before him, he <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page270"></a>{270}</span>has learnt all that is to known. This is
  strange, considering the points at issue, and the extent, duration, and
  intensity of the controversies which have been carried on between that
  Church and the rest of Christendom." It is indeed strange, and it happens
  fortunately, looking at the all-important question which now agitates the
  public mind, that the subject should have engaged for some years the
  attention of a learned, acute, and laborious scholar like Mr. Shepherd,
  so that he is enabled to put forth the result of his inquiries upon this
  interesting topic at this moment. Mr. Shepherd's book is indeed a
  startling one: and when we tell our readers that he "has proved, or, to
  say the least, has given such indications as will lead to the proof that
  some documents which have been quoted as authorities in the History of
  the Early Christian Church, are neither genuine nor authentic;" that he
  has pretty well resolved St. Cyprian into a purely mythic personage; and
  shown that all the letters in his works passed between imagined or
  imaginary correspondents,&mdash;we think we are justified in pronouncing
  his <i>History of the Church of Rome</i> a work calculated to excite the
  deepest interest in all who peruse it (and by the omission of all long
  quotations in the learned languages, it is adapted for the perusal of
  all), to exercise great influence on the public mind, and to awaken a
  host of endeavours to combat and overthrow arguments which appear to us,
  however, to be irresistible.</p>

  <p>The Council of the Shakspeare Society has just issued to the members
  the first volume for the present year. It contains <i>Two Historical
  Plays on the Life and Reign of Queen Elizabeth, by Thomas Heywood</i>,
  which are very ably edited, with an Introduction and Notes, by Mr.
  Collier; and we have no doubt will be very acceptable; first, from the

<p class="cenhead">On the 31st of March was commenced the Publication of a</p>

<h2>NATIONAL ILLUSTRATED LIBRARY,</h2>

<p class="cenhead">In Monthly Volumes, each containing Three Hundred and Twenty Pages, and from Thirty to a Hundred Engravings,</p>

<p class="cenhead">Price Half-a-Crown, Beautifully Bound.</p>

<hr class="short" >

  <p>The Age in which we live is essentially of a <i>practical</i>
  character, and the predominant principle influencing all classes is a
  marked desire for <i>cheapness</i>. Cheapness, however, is too often
  found without excellence, and hence this proposition to supply a
  deficiency at present existing in the popular literature of this
  country.</p>

  <p>For some time past the projectors of the present undertaking have felt
  interested in watching the result of an experiment simultaneously made by
  the London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Book Trades; and, having seen that
  cheap, and occasionally indifferent literature, "got up" in a most
  inferior manner, <i>will sell</i>, they feel assured that good and
  judiciously selected works, having the additional advantage of <span
  class="scac">COPIOUS ILLUSTRATION</span>, being produced with the utmost
  attention to general excellence, and published at the moderate price
  fixed upon, cannot fail to secure extensive patronage from the Reading
  Public. The principle upon which they can undertake to supply good books
  at a low rate is, that being themselves the <i>actual producers</i>, they
  are enabled to save the public the expense of all <i>intermediate
  profit</i>.</p>

  <p>As a practical explanation of the above views, <span class="sc">Three
  Sample Volumes</span> of the "<span class="sc">National Illustrated
  Library</span>" were published on the 31st of March. It will be observed
  that these volumes are widely different in character, in order that the
  public may form some idea of the extent and variety of the series
  generally. Afterwards, one volume will be issued monthly. Each volume
  will contain at least 320 crown octavo pages, illustrated according to
  the requirements of the subject-matter, by from 30 to 100 illustrations,
  and will be <i>strongly bound</i> in ornamental cloth boards. Thus, for
  30<i>s.</i> a year, in the course of a short period, a Library of great
  extent and interest may be formed, which shall furnish materials for
  instruction and amusement during the course of a long life.</p>

  <p>The chief advantages which this series of works will present over all
  others&mdash;more especially the closely printed double column editions,
  and the new fashioned, though equally objectionable, Shilling books, with
  their numerous errors, thin paper, and flimsy binding, are the
  following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. A carefully Revised Text.</p>
      <p>2. Judicious Explanatory Foot Notes.</p>
      <p>3. Engravings really Illustrating the Text.</p>
      <p>4. A new and legible Type.</p>
      <p>5. Good Paper and Printing.</p>
      <p>6. Strong neat Binding.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In carrying out their undertaking it will be the endeavour of the
  projectors to bestow upon Half-crown Volumes for the <i>many</i> the same
  typographical accuracy, and the same artistic ability, hitherto almost
  exclusively devoted to high-priced books for the <i>few</i>. Supported by
  the co-operation of the Reading Public, no pains will be spared to
  provide every English home with a complete treasury of knowledge and
  entertainment in the volumes of the "<span class="sc">National
  Illustrated Library</span>."</p>
